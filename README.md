# Statement of purpose

Having been in the infosec space for a few years, my local drive is awash with unstructured notes, thoughts and ideas. This is my attempt to organise them into a logical narative, with the aim to make a useful resource for myself and hopefully others.

There are likely to be pages in which not all steps are included or basic principles are not explained. In these cases, I encourage you to reach out to me via twitter or the associated github repository.

Some key takeaways before diving into the site:

{% hint style="success" %}
* Learn and recap techniques and ideas
* Feel free to contribute 
* Share things you've found
* Hack the gibson
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
* Do not take everything or anything in these notes for **granted** 
* Do not expect every step to be explained in absolute detail; there may be steps missed out or that aren't clear in these notes. Feel free to get in contact if you want to discuss a concept in more detail / clarify something.
* Expect mistakes - do not fire off untested commands blindly in a red team, you will get burnt
* Consult additional resources - I've linked other great resources in the resources tab
* Remember that the security landscape is always changing. An exploit that works today may no longer work when you come to use it.
{% endhint %}

Most techniques have been identified by other security researchers. Wherever possible, there will be links to original sources of information or relevant articles for further reading. If you feel you should be creditied for something and have not, or want to contribute or suggest corrections, get in touch.
